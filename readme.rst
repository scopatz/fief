fief
==================
Fief is a user-space, cross-platform, branched (multi-versioned), asynchronous, 
package manager for scientific computing currently under development.  It aims 
to address the issues of total or partail stack reproducibility while providing
a consisent interface across posix, Windows, Mac OSX (darwin), and HPC systems.
Both source and binary packages are handled easily in the fief model.  As with 
many package mangers, fief is written primarily in Python.  Fief was concived 
of by Anthony Scopatz and co-implemented with John Bachan on top of John's 
``bake`` and ``async`` technologies.
